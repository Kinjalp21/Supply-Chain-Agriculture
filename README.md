# 🚜 Supply Chain Management for Agriculture using AI

This project aims to enhance agricultural supply chain efficiency using Artificial Intelligence and data-driven approaches. It focuses on optimizing crop movement from farms to markets by predicting demand, clustering production zones, and recommending optimal logistics routes.

## 📌 Project Overview

Traditional agricultural supply chains in India suffer from inefficiencies due to lack of visibility, poor forecasting, and logistical challenges. This AI-powered tool helps:

- Predict demand based on historical trends and weather.
- Optimize crop flow through clustering and routing.
- Provide predicted revenue driving decision making.
